1. allocate one instrument members
2. allocate rep-leader
3. allocate marking
4. remove marking and rep-leader from instrument list
5. if anyone only has one instrument left - allocate them to that instrument
6. check how many people can play: timbal, roller, caixa, rep, third
    if p = 1 for any of those instruments - allocate that person to that instrument
7. list order of players by number of instruments they play
8. allocate one person to each remaining instruments with no player associated so far as per their preference
9. check how many people have been assigned a roller  (currentRollerTotal)
10. check how many people have been assigned a third (currentThirdTotal)
11. potentialRollers = roller only + roller higher in priority order compared to third + currentThirdTotal
12. potentialThirds - third only + third higher in priority order compared to roller + currentRollerTotal
13. current Cases:
    1. correct ratio
    3. too many rollers, not enough currentThirds
        check if there is a third to add in so that the correct ratio is met
            if enough thirds - allocate potentialThirdMember to third instrument
            skip if none
    2. too many thirds, not enough rollers
        check if there are enough rollers in potential rollers 
            allocate them accordingly
            if none take them from the "both" group and assign them to third
14. check members assigned to timbal, rep and roller
    case 1 - each instrument group has the same number of members assigned  
        1. assign one member to each group by priority order
        check members again as per first step
        do STEPS 9 AND 10
    case 2 - instrument groups are not balanced
        add member to balance it (by priority order)
        check if groups are balanced
        DO STEPS 9 AND 10


jack = ['timbal','rep','roller']
jack2 = ['roller','rep']
